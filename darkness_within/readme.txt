The Darkness Within (a game based on my short story)
Genre: Horror, Adventure
Windows and Processing
The main mechanic of the game is to tell a story and escape from death

Controls:
Z for the top choice and starts game
X for the bottom choice

The design of this game is to showcase a similar style to the visual novel genre.
Basically, you are Samuel, and one night you realize that you are in a dark forest. You have nothing else to do except
find a way to escape from this forest. The gameplay of this prototype is relatively short due to certain bugs and glitches from reading text files.

How To Open:
Go to either application.windows32/application.windows64 and click on FSWAT.exe.
Otherwise, you can just open the .pde file if you have Processing.
