Cicada: Wait...you beat them?

Cicada: I mean...see, I told you that you could do it.

I honestly don’t know what happened. How did I do any of that?

Cicada: I wish I could tell you mister. You might be the first bean I've seen in quite some time.

Huh? What do you mean?

Cicada: Well mister, in this land beans are a rarity, because of how delicious they were. They might actually be extinct.

<surprise>
Extinct?

Cicada: Yep. But, most people would rather use their stomach than their head. So, lots of people will be trying to eat you.

<ellipses>
This day just gets better and better. First, I get amnesia and now everyone wants to take a bite out of me.

Cicada: Well, not everyone. Some people might be friendly.

Like who?

Cicada: Well for one there's old man worm. He's just north from where we are. Smartest guy I know too.

An old worm?

Cicada: Yep! He knows just about everything about anything. He can probably tell you what's going on here too.

Well, I guess I don't have much of a choice, now do I. Got a name?

Cicada: Cadi. Cadi the Cicada.

Alright then, Cadi. Lead the way.

Cadi: Awesome! He would probably be just digging in the dirt looking for something to eat right about now. And, he doesn't eat beans...I think.

<exclamation>
You think!? You aren't sure?

Cadi: Well, unlike the old man, knowing everything about anything is not one of my skills. Besides, you got any better ideas?

I suppose not...

Cadi: That's what I thought. Just head north from here and you'll find him in no time.

<surprise>
Wait, are you staying here?

Cadi: Well, cicadas usually dig instead of walk, so you would not see me if I was near you. Besides, now that you beat all those ants it might be safe to dig for some food.

<ellipses>
Just what kind of hell did I walk into?

<off>
