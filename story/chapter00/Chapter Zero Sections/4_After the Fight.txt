Caterpillar: Wait...you beat them?

<surprised>
Caterpillar: I mean...see, I told you that you could do it.

<sigh>
I honestly don’t know what happened. How did I do any of that?

What...what am I?

Cadi: You're a bean!

Whatever it is, it’s clear that you need answers.

So, you said this worm guy would be able to help?

Cadi: Yep! He’s the smartest guy I know!

<sigh>
Guess I don't have much of a choice. Guess I'll go see him then.

Cadi: Awesome! Just head south from here. He usually hangs out near a large sun flower. You can't miss it!

<confused>
Wait, aren't you coming too?

Cadi: Cicada's dig underground, so you won't see me. Don't you know anything mister?

<sigh>
