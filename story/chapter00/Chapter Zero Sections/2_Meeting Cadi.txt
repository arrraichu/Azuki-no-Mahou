??: It’s been a while since we saw one of you. Welcome to the Plains.

Are...are you giant caterpillar?

??: Cicada! Not a caterpillar, not a roach, not a worm. A CI-CA-DA!

<exclamation>
Okay, okay I get it. Just never seen one before.

Cicada: Well gee mister, haven’t you see a cicada before. Guess this time we got a weird one.

I meant this is the first time seeing a giant talking one.

Cicada: That sounds pretty rich coming from a talking bean.

<question>
Bean?

Wait...

Where are my arms?

<surprise>
Where are my legs?

No...What the hell? This can’t be right.

<surprise>
What the hell happened to me!?

Cicada: Are you listening mister? You. Are. A. Bean.

Bean!? What the hell do you mean a bean!

Cicada: Well, you look like a bean, and you smell like one. So, it would be a safe guess that you are one.

<ellipses>
This is a nightmare.

Cicada: It could be worse. You could be...

<monster sounds>

Cicada: ...Lunch...

<surprise>
What was that?

Cicada: That, would be some ants. And they sound hungry.

Are they friendly?

Cicada: If by friendly, you mean blood thirsty, then yea. 

Well why are we just standing here? 

Cicada: Because ants are faster than us and can dig under ground. Getting away is not really possible.

<surprise>
Well, what can we do then?

Cicada: Fight them!

Fight them? How!?

Cicada: I dunno, your the bean. You figure it out.
<fight>
