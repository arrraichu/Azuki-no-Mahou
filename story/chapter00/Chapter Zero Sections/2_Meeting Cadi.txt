??: It’s been a while since we saw one of you. Welcome to the Plains.

Are...are you giant caterpillar?

<exclamation>
??: Cicada! Not a caterpillar, not a roach, not a worm. A CI-CA-DA!

<exclamation>
Okay, okay I get it. Just never seen one before.

Cicada: Well gee mister, haven’t you see a cicada before. Guess this time we got a weird one.

I meant I've never seen a giant talking one before.

Cicada: That's pretty rich coming from a talking bean.

Bean?

<question>

Wait...

<surprise>
Where are my arms?

Where are my legs?

<surprise>
No...What the hell? This can’t be right.

<surprise>
What the hell happened to me!?

Cicada: Like I said, you're a bean

Bean!? What the hell do you mean I'm a bean!

Well, you look like a bean, and you smell like one. So, I'd guess that you are one.

<ellipses>
This is a nightmare.

Cicada: It could be worse. You could be...

<monster sounds>

<ellipses>
Cicada: ...Lunch...

<surprise>
What was that?

Cicada: That, would be some ants. And they sound hungry.

<surprise>
Are they friendly?

Cicada: If by friendly, you mean blood thirsty, then yea. 

<surprise>
Shouldn't we run?

Cicada: Won't do you any good. Ants are fast, and they can dig. We wouldn't get far.

Well, what can we do then?

Cicada: Fight them!

Fight them? How!?

Cicada: I dunno, your the bean. You figure it out.
<fight>
