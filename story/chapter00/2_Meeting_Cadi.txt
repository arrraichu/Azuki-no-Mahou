??: Been a while since we saw one of you. Welcome to the Plains.
Are...are you giant caterpillar?
??: Cicada! Not a caterpillar, not a roach, not a worm. A CI-CA-DA!
<exclamation>
Okay, okay I get it. No need to bite my head off.
Cicada: Well gee mister, am I the first cicada you ever put your eyes on? Guess this time we got a weird one.
Well, this is the first time seeing a giant talking one.
Cicada: That sounds pretty rich coming from a talking bean.
<question>
Bean?
Wait...
Where are my arms?
<exclamation>
Where are my legs?
No...What the hell? This...
<exclamation>
What the hell happened to me!?
Cicada: Are you listening mister? You. Are. A. Bean.
Bean!? What the hell do you mean a bean!
Cicada: Well, you look like a bean, and you smell like one. So, it would be a safe assume that you are one.
<ellipses>
This is a nightmare.
Cicada: It could be worse. You could be...
<monster sounds>
...
Cicada: ...Lunch...
<exclamation>
What was that?
Cicada: That, would be some ants. And from the sounds of it, they're digging towards us.
Are they friendly?
Cicada: If by friendly, you mean blood thirsty, then yea.
Well, what do they eat?
Cadi: Beans...
<exclamation>
Well why are we just standing here!? We can run right?
Cicada: Ants move way faster than Cicadas. Probably beans too.
<exclamation>
Well, what can we do then?
Cicada: Fight them!
Fight them? How!?
Cicada: I dunno, just slam your body into them or something.
Me!? What about you?
Cicada: I said they eat beans, not cicadas. Good luck though.
