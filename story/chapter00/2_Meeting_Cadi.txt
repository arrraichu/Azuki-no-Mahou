??: Been a while since we saw one of you. Welcome to the Plains.
Are...are you giant caterpillar?
??: Cicada! Not a caterpillar, not a roach, not a worm. A CI-CA-DA!
<exclamation>
Okay, okay I get it. Just never seen one before.
Cicada: Well gee mister, I guess this the first see a cicada before. Guess this time we got a weird one.
I meant this is the first time seeing a giant talking one.
Cicada: That sounds pretty rich coming from a talking bean.
<question>
Bean?
Wait...
Where are my arms?
<exclamation>
Where are my legs?
<exclamation>
What the hell happened to me!?
Cicada: Are you listening mister? You. Are. A. Bean.
Bean!? What the hell do you mean a bean!
Cicada: Well, you look like a bean, and you smell like one. So, it would be a safe guess that you are one.
<ellipses>
This is a nightmare.
Cicada: It could be worse. You could be...lunch.
<exclamation>
What was that?
Cicada: That, would be ants.
Are they friendly?
Cicada: If by friendly, you mean blood thirsty, then yea.
Well, what do they eat?
Cadi: Beans...
Screw that, gonna get the hell out of here.
Cicada: Wasting your time. Ants are way faster then you, and they dig. I give you about sixty seconds before you wind up in their mouth.
<exclamation>
Well, what can we do then?
Cicada: Fight them?
Fight them? How?
Cicada: I dunno, just slame your body into them or something. Figure it out.
<fight>
