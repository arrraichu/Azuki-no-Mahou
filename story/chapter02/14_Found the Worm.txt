This him?
Cadi: Yea. but we got here too late...
<exclamation>
Wait...you mean he...
Cadi: Sleeping? Yea.
Sleeping? I thought you meant...
<ellipses>
Never mind. So, should we wake him?
Cadi: Dunno think we can. He usually sleeps pretty heavily. He once slept through a mud tsunami. Didn't wake til three days after it ended.
So, how do we ask him questions?
Cadi: We just have to wait it out. Hope he wakes up soon. Tends to be pretty boring out here.
Well, hopefully no one attacks me til then.
Cadi: Well, someone seems interested in us. Look, that rabbit is coming to say hi.
<exclamation>
Rabbit?
Cadi: Yea, look over there. Coming right towards us.
<ellipses>
I remember you saying rabbits eat beans.
Cadi: Oh...right...I'll just hide over there if you need me.
