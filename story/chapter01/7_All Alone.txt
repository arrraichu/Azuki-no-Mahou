Cadi: Ugh! This soil is bad.
What do you mean?
Cadi: The soil up ahead is wet so, trying to move through it is impossible for me. Gonna have to go through there by yourself.
Oh, well hopefully I can manage. What are you gonna do?
Cadi: I can try and dig under the trees and bushes. You just uh...be careful in there.

<monster sounds>
Cadi: gone...

Do ants make that sound?
Cadi: No, they do not. Maggots on the other hand...
