Cadi: Of all the stupid things!
<question>
What happened?
Cadi: Rocks in the way. Dunno if I can move em.
Can we go around them?
Cadi: I can dig around them, but no way I can make a hole big enough for you.
<exclamation>
Am I really that big?
Cadi: Um...yea I think so.
<ellipses>
...
Cadi: Hey, why not try that hole over there.
But...ants use that.
Cadi: And?
That...seems like a bad idea.
Cadi: You got a better idea?
<ellipses>
...So, I just climb down it?
