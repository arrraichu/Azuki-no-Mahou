Well, no way I will ever doing that again.
Cadi: Glad you could join us. How was the tunnel?
Terrifying and full of things that would love nothing better then to rip me limb from limb and swallow me whole. So, not that bad really.
Cadi: Well, glad you had fun.
So, what did I miss?
Cadi: Well, we got another problem.
Is there an army of groundhogs or something?
Cadi: Actually it would be more of a personal problem. No way I can go through this grass.
<question>
What do you mean?
Cadi: The soil up ahead is wet so, trying to move through it is impossible for me. Gonna have to go through there by yourself.
Oh, well hopefully I can manage. What are you gonna do?
Cadi: I can try and dig under the trees and bushes. You just uh...be careful in there.
<question>
Why? Is there something in there other than ants?
Cadi: Yea, but if these seed corns are all open then they should all be-
<monster sounds>
Cadi: gone...
<question>
Do ants make that sound?
Cadi: No, they do not. Maggots on the other hand...
