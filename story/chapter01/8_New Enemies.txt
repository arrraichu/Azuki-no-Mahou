Cadi: Just what the hell did you do?

I'm not really sure myself. It felt...like I was borrowing energy from something.

Cadi: I've heard that before. Think plants do it.

Do you remember what the name is?

Cadi: Photo...photo...

Photosynthesis?

Cadi: No, not that.

<ellipses>
I don't think that was the correct term anyway.

Cadi: Well, whatever the name, it means you absorb stuff from the ground an use it to do stuff.

Can all beans do that?

Cadi: I think so. But usually, people just say it makes them tastier. Not really sure how it makes you fight better, but whatever.

I'm gonna go on ahead.

Cadi: Aright. Try not to die.
