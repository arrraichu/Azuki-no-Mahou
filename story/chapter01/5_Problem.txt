Cadi: What is what?

Looks like some kind of seed on the ground. Looks beige. Kind of looks like a chickpea.

Cadi: Oh. That would be a seedcorn.

Well, it looks like whatever was inside popped out of it. Looks like something came out of it.

Cadi: Oh...that might be a problem.

Cadi: Nothing to worry about. Probably nothing. Let me go try and scout a little bit ahead.

<question>
Okay...
