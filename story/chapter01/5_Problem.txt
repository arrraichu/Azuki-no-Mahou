What is this?
Cadi: What is what?
Looks like some kind of seed on the ground. Looks beige. Kinda chickpea.
Cadi: Oh. That would be a seed corn.
Well, it looks like whatever was inside popped out of it. The side of it has a huge hole in it and the insides are gone.
Cadi: Oh...that might be a problem.
<question>
Why?
Cadi: Nothing to worry about. Probably nothing. Let me go try and scout a little bit ahead.
<question>
Okay...
