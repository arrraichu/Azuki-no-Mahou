Cicada: Wait...you beat them?
Cicada: I mean...see! I told you that you could do it.
How...how did I do any of that?
Cicada: I wish I could tell you mister. You might be the first bean to be seen in the planes in quite some time.
Huh? What do you mean?
Cicada: Well, most people would rather use their stomach than their head. And beans are a bit of a delicacy around here.
<ellipses>
This day just gets better and better. First, I get amnesia and now everyone wants to take a bite out of me.
Cicada: Well, not everyone. Some people might be friendly.
Like who?
Cicada: Well there is old man worm. He lives just north from where we are now. Smartest guy I know too.
A worm?
Cicada: Yep! He knows just about everything about anything. He can probably tell you why you somethng about what happened to you.
Well, what choice do I have? Got a name?
Cicada: Cadi. Cadi the Cicada.
Alright then, Cadi. Lead the way.
Cadi: Awesome! He would probably be just digging in the dirt looking for something to eat right about now. And, his diet is bean free...I think.
<exclamation>
You think!?
Cadi: Well, unlike the old man, knowing everything about anything is not one of my skills. Besides, you got any better ideas?
I suppose not...
Cadi: So, like I was saying just head north from here and you should see him soon enough.
<question>
Wait, are you staying here?
Cadi: Well, cicadas usually dig instead of walk, so you would not see me if I was near you. Besides, now that you beat all those ants it might be safe to dig for some food.
<ellipses>
...
Cadi: Just relax. Should only be a few minutes before I catch up.
<ellipses>
Just what kind of hell did I walk into?
