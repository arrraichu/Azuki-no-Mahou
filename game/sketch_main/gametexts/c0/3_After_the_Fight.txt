Cicada: Wait...you beat them?

Cicada: I mean...see, I told you that you could do it.

I honestly don’t know what happened. How did I do any of that?

Cicada: Well, you're a bean. Fighting stuff comes with the territory.You're a bean!

<question>
Huh? What do you mean?

Cicada: Well mister, in this land beans are a rarity. They always seem to be great fighters, but they're also supposed to be very tasty. So, lots of people will be trying to eat you.

<ellipses>
This day just gets better and better...

And I still can’t remember anything either.

Cicada: Well mister if its help you need, I could take you to see old worm. He's just north from where we are.

An old worm?

Cicada:  Yep! He knows just about everything about anything. He can probably tell you what's going on here too.

Well, I guess I don't have much of a choice, now do I. Got a name Cicada?

Cicada: It's Cadi.

Alright then, Cadi. Let's go see this "old worm" then.

Cadi: Awesome! He's usually just digging in the dirt looking for something to eat right about now. And, he doesn't eat beans...I think.

<exclamation>
You think?

Cadi: Well, it's not like I know everything about anything. Besides, you got any better ideas?

<ellipses>
I suppose not.

Cadi: That's what I thought. Just head north from here and you'll find him in no time.

Wait, aren't you coming too?

Cadi: Well, cicadas usually dig, so you wouldn't really see me if I was near you. Besides, now that you beat all those ants it might be safe to dig for some food.

<ellipses>
Just what kind of hell did I walk into?
