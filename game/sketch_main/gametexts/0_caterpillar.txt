Huh?
?? : It’s been a while since we saw one of you. Welcome to the Plains.
What the hell man!? You scared me have to death. Who are you?
?? : Well gee mister, haven’t you see a caterpillar before. Guess this time we got a weird one.
Do you at least have a name?
?? : Caterpillar, of course.
You’re name’s caterpillar?
Caterpillar: Yea. What else would I be named? Butterfly? I’m not quite there yet, ya know. I’m still missing the wings.


Caterpillar: You, okay mister? It’s such a beautiful day today.
Well for one thing, I’m a bean. I wasn’t a bean yesterday. At least...I think I wasn’t.

Ugh...still can’t remember. 
Caterpillar: Well mister if its help you need, I could take you to see Old man Worm. He knows just about everything about anything.


Ants? Are they friendly?
Caterpillar: Fight them!
Fight them? How!?
